## Setting up Code with Virtual Python Environment 
- Used a python virtual environment to isolate the dependancies from the requirements.txt
- Some documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

## Changes to requirements.txt
- Within my venv, the requirements2.txt combination of dependency versions worked for me
- Might need to adjust for your own 
- Run "pip3 install -r requirements2.txt" to ensure all dependencies are installed
