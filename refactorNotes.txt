Based on the initial overview of the contents of each file, here's a brief summary of their roles and interactions:

driver.py:
This appears to be the main file that orchestrates the entire process. It initializes the environment, including TensorFlow and Ray, and sets up the necessary configurations. It likely manages the overall workflow, including initiating training and handling data flow.
Ray_ACNet.py:
This file defines the ACNet (Actor-Critic Network) class, which is central to the reinforcement learning model. It includes the neural network architecture, likely combining policy and value networks essential for actor-critic methods.
Worker.py:
This file defines a Worker class, which is probably used for interacting with the environment. Workers are likely responsible for collecting experiences, computing gradients, and possibly updating the global network.
Runner.py:
This file defines a Runner class that seems to be responsible for running simulations on workers. It might handle the execution of gradient computation and other tasks necessary for training the model in a distributed manner.
To refactor these files for TensorFlow 2.x, the main tasks will involve:

Removing TensorFlow 1.x constructs like sessions, placeholders, and tf.reset_default_graph().
Adopting TensorFlow 2.x features like eager execution, the Keras API for model creation, and new methods for tensor manipulation and neural network layers.
Revising data flow and training loops to align with TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution and dataset handling.
Updating the Ray and Actor-Critic Network (ACNet) implementation to ensure compatibility with TensorFlow 2.x changes.
I will begin by refactoring each file, focusing on these key aspects. The refactoring process will be done iteratively, ensuring that each file's functionality is preserved and adapted to the new TensorFlow version. Let's start with driver.py, and then proceed to the other files in sequence. I'll read the driver.py file content in detail first to understand its structure and functionality. ​​
The driver.py file serves as the main script for initializing and running the training process. Here's a summary of its key components based on the initial portion of the content:

Imports and Initializations:
The script imports necessary libraries including numpy, tensorflow, os, and ray. It also imports ACNet from Ray_ACNet.py and imitationRunner, RLRunner from Runner.py.
It initializes Ray with GPU settings and sets up TensorFlow configuration.
TensorFlow 1.x Specific Code:
The script uses TensorFlow 1.x functions like tf.reset_default_graph() and tf.ConfigProto, which are not used in TensorFlow 2.x.
It creates a global_step placeholder, which is a typical TensorFlow 1.x pattern for tracking training steps.
Learning Rate Configuration:
The script handles adaptive learning rate settings, calculating the learning rate based on the global step.
Directory Setup:
There's code for creating directories (likely for saving models and other outputs).
Function Definition:
apply_gradients: A function that applies gradients to the global network, indicative of a distributed training setup.
Given this overview, the refactoring will involve:

Removing TensorFlow 1.x Constructs: Replace the TensorFlow 1.x specific code with TensorFlow 2.x equivalents. This includes removing the reset of the default graph, replacing tf.ConfigProto with TensorFlow 2.x GPU settings, and handling global_step within TensorFlow 2.x's training loop.
Adapting Learning Rate Configuration: Ensure the adaptive learning rate is compatible with TensorFlow 2.x's optimizer approach.
Updating Function Definitions: Modify functions like apply_gradients to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.x's model training and optimization strategies.
Next, I will read through the entire driver.py file to understand all its components in detail and then start the refactoring process, beginning with this file. ​​
The content of driver.py reveals a complex script that integrates TensorFlow with Ray for distributed training, specifically for a reinforcement learning (RL) scenario. Here's a detailed breakdown of its key components and functionalities:

Environment Setup:
Initializes Ray for distributed computing.
Configures TensorFlow 1.x settings (like tf.ConfigProto and tf.reset_default_graph), which are outdated in TensorFlow 2.x.
Directory Creation:
Creates directories for storing model outputs and other data.
Global Step and Learning Rate:
Defines a TensorFlow placeholder for global_step and computes an adaptive learning rate. This approach is not compatible with TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution.
Function Definitions:
apply_gradients: Applies gradients to the global network. This function uses TensorFlow 1.x sessions, which need to be updated.
writeImitationDataToTensorboard, writeEpisodeRatio, writeToTensorBoard: Functions for writing various metrics to TensorBoard. TensorFlow 2.x has a different API for handling summaries and TensorBoard integration.
Main Training Loop:
The script seems to manage two types of training episodes: Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
It creates instances of imitationRunner and RLRunner, likely representing different training strategies for IL and RL episodes.
The script manages a training loop where it waits for jobs (training episodes) to complete, processes their results, and updates the global network.
The script includes logic for saving the model periodically and handling keyboard interrupts.
Refactoring Plan for driver.py:

Remove TensorFlow 1.x Specific Code: Replace tf.reset_default_graph, tf.ConfigProto, and placeholder usage with TensorFlow 2.x compatible code.
Update Learning Rate Management: Incorporate the adaptive learning rate within TensorFlow 2.x's optimizer or training loop.
TensorBoard Integration: Update the functions for writing to TensorBoard using TensorFlow 2.x's tf.summary API.
Revise Training Loop: Adapt the main training loop to TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution mode. This involves managing the global_step manually and updating how the model is trained and gradients are applied.
Model Saving: Update model saving logic to use TensorFlow 2.x's tf.train.Checkpoint and tf.train.CheckpointManager.
I will start refactoring driver.py with these points in mind. This process will involve iterative testing and adjustments to ensure compatibility and functional equivalence with the original TensorFlow 1.x code. Let's begin with the initial steps of refactoring. ​​
The refactoring process for driver.py has started with the following updates:

Initialization and Setup:
Ray initialization remains the same.
Removed TensorFlow 1.x specific graph and session configuration as TensorFlow 2.x adopts eager execution by default.
Global Step and Adaptive Learning Rate:
Replaced the tf.placeholder for global_step with a regular Python variable.
Created a function get_adaptive_lr to compute the adaptive learning rate, replacing the TensorFlow 1.x graph-based computation.
The next steps in the refactoring process will focus on:

Updating Training Loop: The main training loop will be adapted to TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring it manages global_step correctly and integrates with the updated models and functions from Ray_ACNet.py and Runner.py.
Gradient Application and Model Updates: The way gradients are calculated and applied to the model will be updated to TensorFlow 2.x style, using gradient tapes and Keras model APIs.
TensorBoard Integration: Updating TensorBoard logging to use the TensorFlow 2.x tf.summary API.
Model Saving: Implementing model saving and loading using tf.train.Checkpoint and tf.train.CheckpointManager.
Let's continue with refactoring the training loop and other key components of driver.py. I will now focus on updating the functions related to training, such as apply_gradients, and integrating them with the refactored learning rate management and TensorFlow 2.x APIs. ​​
